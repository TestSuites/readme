# Intro to TestSuites 
TestSuites is an organization focused on providing functional test suites (also called end-to-end integration tests) for well known 
open source projects that impact our society in one way or another. A new repo should be created per functional test suite. Each 
test suite repo should contain a README.md detailing instructions for contributing and working with the test suites in that repo. There
should be an aim to keep test suites consistent between repos as much as possible. However, we do not dictate what tools to use for
testing the target project. Some may use cypress.io, others may use nightwatchjs, etc.
